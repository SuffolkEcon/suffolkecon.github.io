# What are packages?

Packages are plug-ins that make R easier to use. Think of R as a smartphone, a package as an app you download from CRAN, the app store.

  Do not install packages on your Suffolk One Drive account or any other cloud service. Make sure you install on your computer's hard drive.

  We recommend that you update your operating system to its latest version. Otherwise you may run into problems installing R or packages for R.

# Instructions

There are two main ways you can download a package inside R Studio.

## At the console

Run the code `install.packages("packagename")` at the console. For instance, to install the tidyverse, do `install.packages("tidyverse")`.

## From the dropdown menu

Open R Studio, go to "Tools" (the dropdown menu), select "Install packages", and then enter the name of the package you want to install.

For instance, to install `tidyverse`:

<br>

![](install_packages.png){width=75%}
</center>
<br>

and then click "Install". 

Make sure:

* you **don't** change the installation location (leave it to the default)
* you **do** select "install dependencies" (so that if the package requires other packages you don't have, those packages are also installed).


## Updating packages

From time to time you may need to update a package. Easiest way is to open R Studio, go to "Tools", then select "Check for package updates". A dialog box will appear. Select any and all packages you want to update, then click "Install Updates". It looks something like this:
