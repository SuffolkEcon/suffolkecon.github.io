# Instructions

1. Go to the [CRAN mirror](https://www.r-project.org/) -- the worldwide server on which R is stored -- and click "download R".
2. "CRAN" means "Comprehensive R Archive Network". It's a network of servers around the world connected together to store the language. You need to choose a "mirror" or a server near you. We're in Boston, so we'll scroll down to "USA" and choose the page for "Statlib, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA": http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/.
3. At the top of that page choose your operating system: Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows. Follow the download instructions.
