# Full overview 

Below are some of the most common Markdown decorations. [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a way to write HTML without actually writing HTML. R Markdown uses Pandoc, a document coverter, to turn Markdown into HTML, Word, PowerPoint or PDF documents. (Heads up, you need a LaTeX distribution to make PDF documents. Learn more [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html).)

For a full overview of R Markdown read through the [official docs](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html). They are useful if you are working on a large document (e.g., a paper or slideshow). Even better (and longer) is the [definitive guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

# YAML

This is the stuff at the top of an R Markdown document (between the `---`) that prints stuff like the title and author, and determines the overall design of the document. ([YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#:~:text=YAML%20(a%20recursive%20acronym%20for,is%20being%20stored%20or%20transmitted.) is a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language").

A generic YAML looks like this:

```
---
title: "title"
subtitle: "subtitle"
author: "author"
output: html_notebook
---
```

Technically each field but `output` can be left blank, but don't leave them blank, because it's bad form.

In `output` you can add lots of options to change the style of the document, though we recommend you keep things simple. The YAML for this document is:

```
---
title: "Markdown"
subtitle: "SuffolkEcon"
author: ""
output: 
  html_notebook:
    number_sections: true
    theme: readable
    highlight: pygments
    toc: true
    toc_float: 
      collapsed: yes
---
```

`theme` sets the [Boostrap theme](https://bootswatch.com/3/) that is built-in with R Markdown. `highlight` is the theme to [make code chunks pretty](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/appearance-and-style-1.html).

# Sections

Sections or headers are made with hastags `#`:


```
# Section 
## Subsection
### Subsubsection
```


# Text

## Plain

```
Just write text with no decorations. 
```

Just write text with no decorations. 

## Paragraphs

Skip a line to write a paragraph. Write short paragraphs. 

```
Here is my first paragraph. 

Here is my second paragraph. 
```


## Bold 

Wrap with a double `**`.

```
**This is bold text.**
```

**This is bold text.**

## Italics


Wrap with a single `*` or `_`:

```
*This is italicized text.*
```

or

```
_This is italicized text._
```

_This is italicized text._

## Strikethrough

Wrap with a single `~`:

```
~I regret this text.~
```

## Quotes

Use a single `>`:

```
> It was the best of times, it was the blurst of times.
```

> It was the best of times, it was the blurst of times.

## Hyperlinks

Use `[link description](the_actual_link)`

For example:

```
[It was the best of times, it was the blurst of times.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_elVGGgW8&ab_channel=KhayeAyuban)
```

[It was the best of times, it was the blurst of times.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_elVGGgW8&ab_channel=KhayeAyuban)



# Images

Image must be PNG or JPEG.

```
![](image.png)
```

Control the size with `{width=}`:

```
![](image.png){width=75%}
```

# Code chunks

R code goes inside chunks. Chunks have options you can switch on or off to adjust how the code or output are presented. See https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html. 

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
print("hello, world!")
```
