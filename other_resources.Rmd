# Websites

The internet is filled with R resources. (Case in point, this website!) Here are two non-obvious and highly valuable resources:

* [CRAN Task View: Econometrics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Econometrics.html). An encyclopedia of R functions and packages for econometrics.
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r). A free Q&A website for coding questions. Possibly one of the most valuable public goods on the internet. 
* [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). New and interesting data sets released every week by the people who made the tidyverse. 

# Books

* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is the standard introductory text to data science with R and the tidyverse. If you only work through one book, make it this one.
* [Modern Dive](https://moderndive.netlify.app/index.html) is another (and longer) introduction to R and the tidyverse.
* [Econometrics with R](https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/) is a great text for econometrics (though it does not use the tidyverse).
* [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/). For advanced users who really want to hone their skills. 
* [R Markdown Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/). The definitive guide!
