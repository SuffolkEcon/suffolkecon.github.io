# What is a notebook? 

Scripts only let you write code and comments. Notebooks let you write code and text -- headers, paragraphs, etc. -- in the same document. By default they render into an easy-to-read HTML document. 

Notebooks always have the `.Rmd` extension (e.g., `notebook.Rmd`.)

# Creating a notebook

Do"File -> New File -> R Notebook". A demo notebook will pop up. Delete the demo text and code and start writing/coding!

# Working in a notebook

There are three parts to a notebook:

1. YAML (formatting the document)
2. Text (writing)
3. Code chunks (coding)

### YAML

The stuff at the top in between the `---`. The default is:

```
---
title: "R Notebook"
output: html_notebook
---
```

You can change the title and add an author:

```
---
title: "My title"
author: "First Last"
output: html_notebook
---
```

and that suffices for a basic notebook. For more options see [the Markdown checkpoint](https://suffolkecon.github.io/markdown.nb.html#2_YAML).


### Text

Write plain text in [Markdown](https://suffolkecon.github.io/markdown.nb.html).

### Code chunks

# Rendering a notebook

Click on "Preview notebook" to see the rendered HTML document. 

Every time you change the file and save it, the document will re-render. 

All notebooks are saved with `.Rmd` extension. After you render the notebook, in your files you will see a new file with the extension `.nb.html`. So iff your notebook is called `notebook.Rmd`, the rendered file is called `notebook.nb.html`.

# R Markdown

R Notebooks are part of a much bigger document ecosystem driven by R Markdown. 

R Markdown lets you turn the same document into a HTML, Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, or PDF.
