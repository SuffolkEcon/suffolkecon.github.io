# What is a script? 

A file just with R code. You can write code, and you can write comments (they start with `#`). When you save the file, the code is still there when you open it again -- unlike code in the console, which disappears when you close R studio.

# Creating a script

Do"File -> New File -> R Script".

# Running a script

You can execute each line of code standalone. Put your cursor on the line and click "Run". Or use the keyboard shortcut (`CMD + ENTER` for Mac/Linux, `CTRL + ENTER` on Windows).

To run the entire script -- every single line of code -- click "Source".
